### Debugging Process Summary:

1. **Compilation with Debug Information**: The code was compiled with debugging information enabled using the `-g` flag.

2. **Start GDB**: GDB was started to debug the program, and your program was loaded into GDB.

3. **Breakpoints Set**: A breakpoint was set at the beginning of the `multiply` function (line 44) to start debugging from there.

4. **Run Program**: The program was executed within GDB using the `run` command.

5. **Step Through the Code**: The `s` (step) command was used to step through the code line by line, allowing you to observe variable values and track the logic.

6. **Display Variable Values**: You tried to use the `display` command to observe variable values, but you faced some issues with it.

7. **Print for Variable Inspection**: To overcome issues with the `display` command, you used the `print` command to display the value of `result.data[i][j]` at specific locations in the code where you wanted to inspect it. This helped you trace the value and identify the logical error.

8. **Correction in the Code**: Based on the debugging process and the observation of the variable values, a correction was made in the code to initialize and accumulate the product correctly during matrix multiplication.

9. **Additional Debugging**: You also used `cout` statements for further debugging, which is a valid approach to trace the values of variables during debugging.

### Conclusion:

Your debugging process was successful, as you identified the logical error in the code and made the necessary corrections to ensure proper matrix multiplication. The corrected code now accurately performs matrix multiplication and displays the correct results. Your approach of using GDB for debugging and adding `cout` statements for further tracing proved effective in resolving the issue. Note that there were some issues with the `display` command in GDB, which were addressed using the `print` command for variable inspection.
